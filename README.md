The one that just not exploit IPMI protocol.

# What the hack is IPMI?

### Academic way to say
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of computer interface specifications for an autonomous computer subsystem that provides management and monitoring capabilities independently of the host system's CPU, firmware (BIOS or UEFI) and operating system. IPMI defines a set of interfaces used by system administrators for out-of-band management of computer systems and monitoring of their operation. For example, IPMI provides a way to manage a computer that may be powered off or otherwise unresponsive by using a network connection to the hardware rather than to an operating system or login shell.

### Noob way to say
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a service and runs in general on port 623 which allows you to manage or monitor capabilities independently of the host system's CPU, firmware (BIOS or UEFI) and operating system.

### Hackers way to say
nmap target => port 623 => IPMI => Jackpot (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
